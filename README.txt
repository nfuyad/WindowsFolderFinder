Currently this application is Terminal based and does not have a GUI.


When you run the .exe file Windows might tell you to do not run but it is ok.


Instruction:

-Just run the file.
-Type the name of the drive you want to search into. Example: C:\
-Type what you want to search. It will exit on it's own when it's done searching.
-It will create a text file where the .exe file is located. SearchResult.txt
-You will find your search results there.

Searching files in the windows file manager can be time consuming and quite frustrating. With this application you can do that within a moment.
